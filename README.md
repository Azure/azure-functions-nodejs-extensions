# Azure Functions TypeScript Extensions

This repository is for the active development of the Azure Functions extensions for the TypeScript worker.  
For consumers of these extensions, we recommend visiting our [public developer docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/azure/).

## Getting started

Each binding type is published as an individual package, allowing you to use only the libraries you need.  
To get started with a specific binding library, check the `README.md` file located in its respective project folder.

### Prerequisites

These libraries are supported on Function Apps using Node.js 16 or later with TypeScript.  
For full compatibility details, refer to our [Azure Functions version support policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-versions?pivots=programming-language-javascript#languages).

## SDK Support
